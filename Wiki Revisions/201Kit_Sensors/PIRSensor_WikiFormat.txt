== Description ==
The Pyroelectric Infrared Sensor can detect changes in heat in an area. PIR is commonly used to detect the movement of people.
PIR sensors use an infrared probe to passively detect ambient heat over an area with a given range. The Microduino PIR sensor integrates a small processor and a small, highly reliable probe (the AM412) into our standard interface to add PIR sensing to any Microduino project.
It should be noted that there will be a delayed high level output when the PIR signal exceeds a selected digital threshold. All the signal processing is done on one chip.
