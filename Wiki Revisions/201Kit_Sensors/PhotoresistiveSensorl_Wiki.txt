PhotoresistiveSensor_Description

== Description ==
The Microduino Light Sensor uses a photosensitive resistor to detect the amount of ambient light present. The sensor is effectively a resistor that changes in value as the light intensity surrounding it changes. The sensor will output a voltage value that corresponds to the amount of light detected by the sensor.

Couple the sensor to an LED and you have a smart light that illuminates a room as it gets dark!

== Specifications ==
=== Dimensions ===
**Board: 20mm x 10mm
**Connector: 4-Pin interface, 1.27mm-pitch

=== Electrical ===
**Analog Output Device
**Analog Output: 0-1023 (with Microduino Core modules) 

=== Operational ===
**Bright Resistance(up to 100Lux): 8-20kO
**Dark Resistance: 1MO

**Sensitivity:
***Given light intensity of 10Lux and 100Lux, with corresponding resistances (R10 and R100), the sensitivity factor is 0.8. This gives you a sense of how resistance changes with a given quantitative change in the amount of light present.

**Pins: Signal, VCC (power), GND (ground) and NC (not connected)
**'''''NOTE''''': Sensor must be connected to analog capable ports (i.e. A0-A7)
