==Outline==
The Microduino Light Sensor uses a photosensitive resistor to detect the amount of ambient light present. The sensor is effectively a resistor that changes in value as the light intensity surrounding it changes. The sensor will output a voltage value that corresponds to the amount of light detected by the sensor.

Couple the sensor to an LED and you have a smart light that illuminates a room as it gets dark!

==Specification==
*Electrical Specifications
**Analog Output Device
**Analog Output: 0-1023 (with Microduino Core modules)  
*Technical Specifications
**Bright Resistance(up to 100Lux): 8-20kO
**Dark Resistance: 1MO
**Sensitivity:
***Given light intensity of 10Lux and 100Lux, with corresponding resistances (R10 and R100), the sensitivity factor is 0.8. This gives you a sense of how resistance changes with a given quantitative change in the amount of light present.
*Dimensions
**Board: 20mm x 10mm
**Connector: 4-Pin interface, 1.27mm-pitch
*Connection Interface
**Pins: Signal, VCC (power), GND (ground) and NC (not connected)
**'''''NOTE''''': Sensor must be connected to analog capable ports (i.e. A0-A7)

===Preparation===
*Setup 1:Connect Microduino-Light and the A0 analog port of the Hub.  
[[file:mCookie-pir-sensor.JPG|600px|center]]
*Setup 2:Connect the CoreUSB, Hub and Light to the computer with a USB cable.

===Experiment: Detect analog Brightness Value ===
* Open Arduino IDE and copy the following code into IDE.
<source lang="cpp">
#define  sensorPin  A0

int state;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(sensorPin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop()
{
  state = analogRead(sensorPin);
  Serial.print("state:");
  Serial.println(state);
  delay(100);
}
</source>
* Select the right board from Tools?Serial Port in Arduino IDE and download the program. [[file:uploadlight.JPG|600px|center]]
[[file:uploadlight1.JPG|600px|center]]
*After the download, you can open the serial monitor. The displayed value reflects the current light intensity. 
[[file:uploadlight3.JPG|600px|center]]
*Result 
The stronger the light is, the greater the output value becomes. Therefore, you can build some projects controlled by light intensity change.

===Program Debugging===
*“#define  sensorPin  A0”defines sensor interface. 
*Use“analogRead(sensorPin);”function to read the output analog value of the sensor and therefore, to judge light intensity change. 

==Application==
*Couple the Light Sensor with an LED and you can automate the intensity of the LED based on how bright or dark it is in a room.
