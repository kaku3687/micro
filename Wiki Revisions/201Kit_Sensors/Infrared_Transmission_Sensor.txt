==Outline==
The Microduino IR LED can emit infrared signals just like a remote control. Couple this with an infrared receiver and you can control projects from a distance. The maximum transmission distance for the emitter is 10 meters.

* Select the right board and COM port, compile and download.  You can refer to [[AVR Core：Getting started]] 
[[file:upload.JPG|thumb|800px|center]]
*include <IRremote.h> - Imports the IRremote library and allows you to use all functions.
*IRsend irsend; - Declares an object for the infrared transmitter to use IR functions.
*irsend.sendSony(0xa90, 12); - Sends an infrared code using a Sony remote protocol.
* Once you open the Serial Monitor, you can input any values into the console. The LED on the transmitter will blink once the infrared signal has been sent.
