You can now play, pause and skip songs using just a pair of switches. You can also build a beautiful music box for your project using LEGO since mCookie is designed to be easily connected to LEGO pieces.

== Code ==
The software will check the state of each switch. If the first switch is triggered the music will switch from playing to pause, depending on whether or not anything is currently playing. If the second switch is triggered, the next song in the queue will play if there is more than one song stored in memory.
