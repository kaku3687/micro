CrashSensor_Description

== Description ==
The Microduino Crash Sensor is basically a switch for adding some control to your projects. While open, the switch doesn't allow current to flow and the signal read from the sensor is a digital HIGH. When closed, current flows and the sensor reads LOW.

Use this sensor as an input device for controlling your projects, or mount it onto projects to check and see if something has collided with the sensor (like a smart robot).
